# FullStackOpen Exercises 6.3.-6.8.

Let's make a new version of the anecdote voting application from part 1. Take the project from this repository https://github.com/fullstack-hy2020/redux-anecdotes to base your solution on.

# 6.3: anecdotes, step1
Implement the functionality for voting anecdotes. The number of votes must be saved to a Redux store.

# 6.4: anecdotes, step2
Implement the functionality for adding new anecdotes.

You can keep the form uncontrolled like we did earlier.

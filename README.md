# FullStackOpen Exercises 6.3.-6.8.

Let's make a new version of the anecdote voting application from part 1. Take the project from this repository https://github.com/fullstack-hy2020/redux-anecdotes to base your solution on.

# 6.3: anecdotes, step1
Implement the functionality for voting anecdotes. The number of votes must be saved to a Redux store.

# 6.4: anecdotes, step2
Implement the functionality for adding new anecdotes.

You can keep the form uncontrolled like we did earlier.

# 6.5: anecdotes, step3
Make sure that the anecdotes are ordered by the number of votes.

# 6.6: anecdotes, step4
If you haven't done so already, separate the creation of action-objects to action creator-functions and place them in the src/reducers/anecdoteReducer.js file, so do what we have been doing since the chapter action creators.

# 6.7: anecdotes, step5
Separate the creation of new anecdotes into a component called AnecdoteForm. Move all logic for creating a new anecdote into this new component.
